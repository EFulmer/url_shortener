TODO List
=========

Bugs
----
* Need to 'detect' URLs properly.
* URL database should only be created if it does not already exist.

Usability
---------
* Flash a confirmation message to the user with the shortened URL.
* Flash an error message to the user if they request a shortURL that isn't in the database.
* Maybe come up with a way to use "better" shortened URLs; i.e. not just ericsurlshortneer.com/1?

Features
--------
* ...Need some!

Code Cleanliness
----------------
* Docstrings for all my functions.
