TODO List
=========

Bugs
----
* URL database should only be created if it does not already exist.

Usability
---------
* Flash a confirmation message to the user with the shortened URL.
* Maybe come up with a way to use "better" shortened URLs; i.e. not just ericsurlshortneer.com/1?

Features
--------
* Track how many times a specific URL has been redirected to.
* When users enter URLs in, check whether or not the URL's already in the table, return its short version if so.

Code Cleanliness
----------------
* Rename the URL database.
* Docstrings for all my functions.
